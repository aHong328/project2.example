<div class="headline"> A Timeline of the Assassins from "Assassin's Creed" </div> 

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: arial; margin-left: 110px"> <strong><em>By:</em> Albert Hong </strong> | Oct. 5, 2015</p>

<div class="intro"> The "Assassin's Creed" series of video games had its start with the original back in 2007, placing you as Desmond Miles, a descendant of a long line of Assassins who seeked to ensure the survival of freedom. As Desmond, you relive the memories of your ancestors who were engaged in a war with the Templars, an organization that sought to control humans. With the next installment of the series, "Assassin's Creed Syndicate," set to release on Oct. 23, let's take a look back at the Assassins who you have played as throughout history. </div>
